# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#<VirtualHost *:80>
#	DocumentRoot "/srv/http/sandbox/public"
#	Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
#	<Directory "/srv/http/sandbox/public">
#		DirectoryIndex index.php
#		AllowOverride All
#		Require all granted
#	</Directory>
#</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "/srv/http/vivi/public"
